# MPC Vulnerability Guide

This guide covers common vulnerabilities found in MPC implementations and how to mitigate them.

## Implementation Vulnerabilities

### Input Validation Issues
- **Problem**: Insufficient validation of input parameters
- **Impact**: Can lead to protocol corruption or information leakage
- **Mitigation**: Implement comprehensive input validation

### Randomness Failures
- **Problem**: Poor random number generation or reuse of randomness
- **Impact**: Can completely break security guarantees
- **Mitigation**: Use cryptographically secure random number generators

### Memory Management
- **Problem**: Sensitive data not properly cleared from memory
- **Impact**: Information leakage through memory dumps
- **Mitigation**: Secure memory allocation and explicit clearing

## Protocol-Level Vulnerabilities

### Malleability Attacks
- **Problem**: Adversary can modify messages in transit
- **Impact**: Can corrupt computation or leak information
- **Mitigation**: Use authenticated channels and non-malleable commitments

### Selective Failure Attacks
- **Problem**: Adversary causes protocol to fail selectively based on inputs
- **Impact**: Can leak information about private inputs
- **Mitigation**: Implement robust error handling and abort protocols
