# MPC Security Analysis

Security analysis of MPC protocols requires careful consideration of various threat models and attack vectors.

## Threat Models

### Semi-Honest Adversaries
- Follow protocol specification
- Try to learn additional information from transcripts
- Passive attacks only

### Malicious Adversaries  
- May deviate arbitrarily from protocol
- Can send incorrect messages
- May attempt to learn private inputs
- Can try to corrupt the computation

## Security Proofs

MPC protocols are typically proven secure using:

1. **Simulation-based proofs**: Show that real-world execution is indistinguishable from ideal functionality
2. **Game-based proofs**: Reduce security to well-known cryptographic assumptions
3. **Universal composability**: Ensures security when protocols are composed

## Common Vulnerabilities

- **Timing attacks**: Information leaked through computation timing
- **Side-channel attacks**: Power analysis, electromagnetic emanations
- **Implementation bugs**: Incorrect handling of edge cases
- **Protocol deviation**: Parties not following the specification
