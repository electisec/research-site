# MPC Implementation Guide

Best practices and guidelines for implementing secure and efficient MPC protocols.

## Design Principles

### Security First
- Always start with a formally analyzed protocol
- Implement constant-time operations where possible
- Use secure communication channels

### Performance Considerations
- Minimize communication rounds
- Optimize for the expected network topology
- Consider preprocessing phases for online efficiency

## Implementation Best Practices

### Cryptographic Primitives
- Use well-tested cryptographic libraries
- Implement proper key management
- Ensure forward secrecy when applicable

### Network Communication
- Implement reliable message delivery
- Use authenticated and encrypted channels
- Handle network failures gracefully

### Error Handling
- Implement comprehensive error checking
- Ensure errors don't leak information
- Provide meaningful error messages for debugging

## Testing and Validation

### Unit Testing
- Test individual components thoroughly
- Include edge cases and error conditions
- Verify cryptographic properties

### Integration Testing
- Test full protocol execution
- Include malicious party behavior
- Verify security properties end-to-end

### Performance Testing
- Measure communication complexity
- Benchmark computational overhead
- Test scalability with increasing party count
