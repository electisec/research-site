# Electisec MPC Research

Welcome to Electisec's comprehensive research on Multi-Party Computation (MPC) protocols, privacy-preserving technologies, and cryptographic security analysis.

## Overview

Multi-Party Computation (MPC) represents one of the most powerful and promising areas of modern cryptography. It enables multiple parties to jointly compute functions over their inputs while maintaining the privacy of those inputs. This technology has found applications in diverse fields from privacy-preserving machine learning to secure auctions and financial computations.

## Research Goals

Our MPC research aims to:

- **Advance Security**: Identify and analyze vulnerabilities in existing MPC protocols and implementations
- **Improve Practicality**: Develop more efficient protocols suitable for real-world deployment
- **Educational Impact**: Provide comprehensive resources for developers and researchers
- **Industry Adoption**: Bridge the gap between academic research and practical applications

## Key Research Areas

### Protocol Security
- Formal analysis of MPC protocols under various threat models
- Identification of novel attack vectors and vulnerabilities
- Development of more robust security proofs

### Implementation Security
- Analysis of real-world MPC implementations
- Common implementation pitfalls and best practices
- Side-channel attack resistance

### Performance Optimization
